RENAL DYSFUNCTION AND LOS:
Patients with elevated creatinine (>2.0 mg/dL) often require prolonged hospitalization due to fluid imbalance, electrolyte disturbances, and possible need for dialysis.

RESPIRATORY INSTABILITY AND LOS:
Respiratory rate above 22 breaths/min is associated with respiratory distress or infection, increasing monitoring needs and hospital stay.

INFLAMMATION AND INFECTION:
Elevated neutrophil percentage (>70%) indicates acute infection or inflammation, often requiring intravenous antibiotics and extended inpatient care.

PRIOR HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS:
Patients with multiple prior admissions frequently have chronic comorbidities and slower recovery, leading to longer length of stay.

BMI EFFECTS:
Underweight patients (BMI <18.5) may have poor nutritional reserves, while obese patients (BMI >30) face increased complication risk, both contributing to longer LOS.

CARDIOVASCULAR STRESS:
Abnormal pulse rates (<60 or >100 bpm) suggest cardiovascular instability, requiring continuous monitoring.

ANEMIA AND LOS:
Low hematocrit (<35%) is associated with delayed recovery and increased hospitalization duration.

CLINICAL DECISION NOTE:
Length of stay is influenced by the combination of comorbidities rather than a single factor.
